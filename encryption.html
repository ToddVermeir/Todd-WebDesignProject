  <h2>CYBERSECURITY</h2>

  <p>
Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems such as hardware, software and data from cyber-threats. The practice is used by individuals and enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to data centers and other computerized systems.The goal of implementing cybersecurity is to provide a good security posture for computers, servers, networks, mobile devices and the data stored on these devices from attackers with malicious intent. Cyber-attacks can be designed to access, delete, or extort an organization’s or user’s sensitive data; making cybersecurity vital., Medical, government, corporate and financial organizations, may all hold vital personal information on an individual, for example.
Cybersecurity is a continuously changing field, with the development of technologies that open up new avenues for cyberattacks. Additionally, even though significant security breaches are the ones that often get publicized, small organizations still have to concern themselves with security breaches, as they may often be the target of viruses and phishing.
To protect organizations, employees and individuals, organizations and services should implement cybersecurity tools, training, risk management approaches and continually update systems as technologies change and evolve.</p>

  <h2>Breaches</h2>
</section>
<div class="text-block">
  <p>Not long ago, a breach that compromised the data of a few million people would have been big news. Now, breaches that affect hundreds of millions or even billions of people are far too common. About 3.5 billion people saw their personal data stolen in the top two of 15 biggest breaches of this century alone. The smallest incident on this list involved the data of a mere 134 million people.Although a data breach can be the result of an innocent mistake, real damage is possible if the person with unauthorized access steals and sells Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or corporate intellectual data for financial gain or to cause harm.
Malicious actors tend to follow a basic pattern, as targeting an organization for a breach takes planning. They research their victims to learn where the vulnerabilities are, such as missing or failed updates and employee susceptibility to phishing campaigns. Once they know a target's weak points, they develop a campaign to get insiders to mistakenly download malware, or they go after the network directly. Once inside, malicious actors have the freedom to search for the data they want — and lots of time to do it, as the average breach takes more than five months to detect.</p>
