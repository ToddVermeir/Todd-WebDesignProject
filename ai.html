      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p>If you’re wondering how good your next phone’s camera is going to be, it’d be wise to pay attention to what the manufacturer has to say about AI. Beyond the hype and bluster, the technology has enabled staggering advances in photography over the past couple of years, and there’s no reason to think that progress will slow down.

      <h2>Film</h2>
      <p>The film world is full of intriguing what-ifs. Will Smith famously turned down the role of Neo in The Matrix. Nicolas Cage was cast as the lead in Tim Burton’s Superman Lives, but he only had time to try on the costume before the film was canned. Actors and directors are forever glancing off projects that never get made or that get made by someone else, and fans are left wondering what might have been.

      <h2>Ecology</h2>
      <p>Human is part of nature, one of several beings on the planet.
It is perhaps ironic that within the field of artificial intelligence we talk of deep learning, as one technique, when we often fail to learn about a broader ecology. One may come to realise to some extent it seems more like shallow learning when we fail to take these considerations.</p>

      <h2>Weather </h2>
      <p>Weather forecasting is notoriously difficult, but in recent years experts have suggested that machine learning could better help sort the sunshine from the sleet. Google is the latest firm to get involved, and in a blog post this week shared new research that it says enables “nearly instantaneous” weather forecasts.</p>

      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>From SIRI to self-driving cars, artificial intelligence (AI) is progressing rapidly. While science fiction often portrays AI as robots with human-like characteristics, AI can encompass anything from Google’s search algorithms to IBM’s Watson to autonomous weapons</p>

  <h2>Code</h2>
  <p> Consumers want their product to work, they want it to make their lives easier. This is where the code comes in. The code gives the machine its own conscience, directing it and helping it assess situations and find the best possible outcome</p>

  <h2>Launch</h2>
  <p>The next phase is the launch or testing phase. In order to release a final product, an immense amount of testing is required before its launch. This testing helps the creators find and address bugs, and to look at other ways they can help people </p>
